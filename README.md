## SportsHub Online

SportsHub Online is a web application that allows users to purchase sports tickets online. It provides a platform for users to view available sports events, purchase tickets and view their order history. A QR code is generated for each ticket purchased and users can use it to gain access to the event. Emails are sent to users to confirm their purchase and provide them with the QR code.

UML Diagrams are used to model the system. The class diagram shows the classes and their relationships. The sequence diagram shows the interactions between the classes. The use case diagram shows the use cases and actors.
